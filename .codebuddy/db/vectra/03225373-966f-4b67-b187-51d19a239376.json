If the user is already signed in, they will not be prompted to sign in again. You can build your app as if the user is already signed in, and Puter.js will handle the authentication process for you whenever it's needed.\n\n<figure style=\"margin: 40px 0;\">\n    <img src=\"/assets/img/auth.png\" style=\"width: 100%; max-width: 600px; margin: 0px auto; display:block;\">\n    <figcaption style=\"text-align: center; font-size: 13px; color: #777;\">The user will be automatically prompted to sign in with their Puter.com account when your code tries to access any cloud services or resources.</figcaption>\n</figure>\n\nIf Puter.js is being used in an app published on Puter.com, the user will be automatically signed in and your app will have full access to all cloud services. \n\n## Default permissions\n\nOnce the user has been authenticated, your app will get a few things by default:\n\n- **An app directory** in the user's cloud storage. This is where your app can freely store files and directories. The path to this directory will look like `~/AppData/<your-app-id>/`. This directory is automatically created for your app when the user has been authenticated the first time. Your app will not be able to access any files or data outside of this directory by default.\n\n"}
