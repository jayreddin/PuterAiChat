From cloud storage and database to GPT-4o and Sonnet 3.5, Puter.js has you covered. Sound amazing? well it gets even better, Puter.js is also 100% free forever and [open-source](https://github.com/heyputer/puter/)\\!\n\nThis tutorial will guide you through the process of setting up and using Puter.js in your project to access its powerful features. Let's get started\\!\n\n## Installation\n\nTo begin using Puter.js, simply add it to your HTML file using the following script tag either in the \\<head\\> or \\<body\\> of your HTML file:\n\n\\<script src=\"https://js.puter.com/v2/\"\\>\\</script\\>\n\nThat's it\\! You're now ready to start using Puter.js in your web application. No need to install any dependencies or set up a server. No API keys or configuration required.\n\n## **Example 1**\n\n## Add GPT-4o to your web application\n\nOnce you've added the Puter.js script to your web application, a global puter object will be available for you to use. This object contains all of the functionality provided by Puter.js. For example, to use GPT-4o mini, you can call the puter.ai.chat function:\n\n\\<html\\>  \n\\<body\\>  \n    \\<script src=\"https://js.puter.com/v2/\"\\>\\</script\\>  \n    \\<script\\>  \n        puter.ai.chat(\\`Why did the chicken cross the road?\\`).then(puter.print);  \n    \\</script\\>  \n\\</body\\>  \n\\</html\\>\n\n"}
