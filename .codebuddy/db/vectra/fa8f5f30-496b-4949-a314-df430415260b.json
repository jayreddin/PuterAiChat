To start using Puter.js for key-value store operations, include the following script tag in your HTML file, either in the \\<head\\> or \\<body\\> section:\n\n\\<script src=\"https://js.puter.com/v2/\"\\>\\</script\\>\n\nAll set\\! You can now start using Puter.js for key-value store operations without any additional setup.\n\n## **Example 1**\n\n## Basic Key-Value Operations\n\nLet's start with the basic operations: setting a value, getting a value, and deleting a value.\n\n\\<html\\>  \n\\<body\\>  \n    \\<script src=\"https://js.puter.com/v2/\"\\>\\</script\\>  \n    \\<script\\>  \n        (async () \\=\\> {  \n            // Set a value  \n            await puter.kv.set('user\\_name', 'Alice');  \n            puter.print('Value set\\<br\\>');\n\n            // Get a value  \n            const name \\= await puter.kv.get('user\\_name');  \n            puter.print('Retrieved name:', name, '\\<br\\>');\n\n            // Delete a value  \n"}
