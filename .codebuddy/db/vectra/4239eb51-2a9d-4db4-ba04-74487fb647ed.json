This allows you to add key-value store capabilities to your web applications without worrying about setting up a backend or managing a database.\n\nâ€”----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n## [Tutorials](https://developer.puter.com/tutorials/)\n\n# **Add Upload to Your Website for Free**\n\nThis tutorial will show you how to use Puter.js to add file upload capabilities to your web application for free, without any backend or server setup. Using Puter.js, you can easily allow users to upload files to cloud storage directly from their browser. Puter.js can serve as a powerful, free alternative to traditional file upload solutions such as Amazon S3, Google Cloud Storage, Firebase Storage, or custom server-side implementations.\n\n## Getting Started\n\nPuter.js works out of the box without any additional setup or configuration. To start using Puter.js for file uploads, you only need to include the Puter.js script in your HTML file, either in the \\<head\\> or \\<body\\> section:\n\n\\<script src=\"https://js.puter.com/v2/\"\\>\\</script\\>\n\nThat's it\\! You're now ready to add file upload capabilities to your website using Puter.js. No need to set up a server, manage storage, or worry about API keys.\n\n## **Example 1**\n\n## Basic File Upload\n\nLet's start with a simple example that allows users to upload a single file. This example demonstrates how to use Puter.js to perform basic file uploads. You can select a file using the file input, and then click the \"Upload\" button to upload it to the cloud storage:\n\n\\<html\\>  \n\\<body\\>  \n    \\<input type=\"file\" id=\"file-input\"\\>  \n    \\<button id=\"upload-button\"\\>Upload\\</button\\>  \n    \\<div id=\"result\"\\>\\</div\\>\n\n"}
