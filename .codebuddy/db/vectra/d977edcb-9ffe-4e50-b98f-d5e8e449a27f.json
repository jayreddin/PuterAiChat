This object contains all of the functionality provided by Puter.js. For example, to use GPT-4o mini, you can call the `puter.ai.chat` function:\n\n```html\n<html>\n<body>\n    <script src=\"https://js.puter.com/v2/\"></script>\n    <script>\n        puter.ai.chat(`Why did the chicken cross the road?`).then(puter.print);\n    </script>\n</body>\n</html>\n```\n\nThis is all you need to use GPT-4o mini in your app. No backend code, no configuration, and no API keys. Just include the Puter.js script, and you're ready to start.\n\n## Where to Go From Here\n\nTo learn more about the capabilities of Puter.js and how to use them in your web application, check out\n\n- [Tutorials](https://developer.puter.com/tutorials): Step-by-step guides to help you get started with Puter.js and build powerful applications.\n\n- [Playground](https://docs.puter.com/playground): Experiment with Puter.js in your browser and see the results in real-time.
