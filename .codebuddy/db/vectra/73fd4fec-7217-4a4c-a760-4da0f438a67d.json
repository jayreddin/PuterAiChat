Use streaming for longer responses to provide better user experience  \n2. Choose the appropriate model based on your specific needs:  \n   * Gemini 2.0 Flash for more advanced tasks and better reasoning  \n   * Gemini 1.5 Flash for simpler tasks or when faster response times are priority  \n3. Implement proper error handling for network issues  \n4. Consider adding loading states for better user experience  \n5. Use appropriate retry logic for failed requests\n\nThat's it\\! You now have free access to Gemini's powerful language models using Puter.js. This allows you to add sophisticated AI capabilities to your web applications without worrying about API keys or usage limits.\n\nâ€”--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n## [Tutorials](https://developer.puter.com/tutorials/)\n\n# **Free, Unlimited Text-to-Speech API**\n\nThis tutorial will show you how to use Puter.js to access text-to-speech capabilities similar to Amazon Polly for free, without any API keys or usage restrictions. Using Puter.js, you can convert text to speech for a wide range of applications without worrying about usage limits or costs.\n\n## Getting Started\n\nUsing puter.js does not require any API keys or sign-ups. You can start using Puter.js by including the following script tag in your HTML file, either in the \\<head\\> or \\<body\\> section:\n\n\\<script src=\"https://js.puter.com/v2/\"\\>\\</script\\>\n\nThat's all you need to start using Puter.js for free text-to-speech conversion\\! No API keys or sign-ups required.\n\n## **Example 1**\n\n"}
