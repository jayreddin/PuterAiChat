You now have a free and unlimited authentication system using Puter.js. This allows you to add secure user authentication to your web applications without managing servers or worrying about usage limits.\n\n## Best Practices\n\nWhen implementing authentication in your web applications with Puter.js, always verify the authentication status before displaying protected content. This can be done using the [isSignedIn()](https://docs.puter.com/Auth/isSignedIn/) method at key points in your application flow.\n\nYour application should handle authentication errors gracefully and provide clear feedback to users when authentication fails. It's crucial to update your UI immediately after any authentication state changes to maintain a consistent user experience.\n\nConsider building on top of the authentication system by combining it with other Puter.js features. For example, you might use cloud storage to save user preferences or leverage the AI capabilities to provide personalized experiences for authenticated users.\n\nâ€”--------------------------------------------------------\n\n## [Tutorials](https://developer.puter.com/tutorials/)\n\n# **Free, Unlimited Cloud Save API for Games**\n\nWant to add cloud saves to your game without the hassle of managing servers or databases or paying for proprietary services?
