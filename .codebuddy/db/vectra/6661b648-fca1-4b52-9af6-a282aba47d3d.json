Always check for data validity when loading saves \\- use try/catch blocks and verify data structure.  \n2. Save timestamps with your game data to show players when they last saved.  \n3. For large save files (like complete game worlds), use [puter.fs.write()](https://docs.puter.com/FS/write/) instead of puter.kv.  \n4. Implement auto-saves after important game events, not on a timer.  \n5. Keep save data small by only storing essential information.\n\n## Advanced Features\n\nFor larger games, consider using these additional features:\n\n// Save file versioning  \nconst saveData \\= {  \n    version: \"1.0\",  \n    player: playerState,  \n    timestamp: Date.now()  \n};\n\n// Compress large saves  \nconst compressed \\= btoa(JSON.stringify(saveData));  \nawait puter.kv.set('gameSave', compressed);\n\n// Multiple save slots  \nawait puter.kv.set(\\`save\\_slot\\_${slotNumber}\\`, saveData);\n\nâ€”-------------------------------\n\n## [Tutorials](https://developer.puter.com/tutorials/)\n\n# **Free, Unlimited OCR API**\n\nNeed to extract text from images in your web application?
